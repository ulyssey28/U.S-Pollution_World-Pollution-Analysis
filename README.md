# Air Pollution Analysis (U.S/ World Pollution)

## Background and Focus of this Study

Air pollution is the emission of harmful substances, pollutants, to the atmosphere.

Toxic air pollutants of concern :
* Sulphur dioxide (SO2): Forms in the air  by the burning of fossil fuels by power plants and other industrial facilities
* Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): Forms from vehicle emission and power plants. Can aggravate respiratory diseases 
* Ozone (O3): Harmful to lungs and is the main constituents of smog/haze
* Carbon monoxide (CO): Emitted by vehicles that burn fossil fuels
* Particulate matter (PM2.5) (small suspended particles of varying sizes): Tiny bits of dust, dirt, smoke that hang in the air. Can penetrate into the lungs and cause breathing problems

AQI(Air  Quality Index)
* A measure of how clean or polluted the air is in a given time and location
* Identifies any health risks to individuals 

## Approach 
### Overall Question:
What are some of the major influences on Air pollution and what are some of the effects of air pollution? 

### Analysis Questions:
1. What are the most polluted countries in the world?
* What are some factors that could influence a region's concentration of pollutant AQI levels
(Example: Populations, GDP, Fuel emmisions...)

With some of these potential influences in mind we then transitioned into a focus on the U.S

2. What is the trends of major air pollutants in the United States over time?

3. How is US GDP trending over time in comaprison to the trend of major air pollutants?

4. How do pollutant levels affect health? 
(What are the effects of high pollutant levels on the following?)
* Mortality Rates
* Asthma
